we need following for redux:

1. STORE -> GLOBALIZED STATE

2. ACTION -> ANY NAME THAT YOU WANT TO DO (INCREMENT, GET, PUSH, POST)
	-> action is a simple function that returns a object

3. REDUCER -> HOW YOUR ACTION TRANSFORM YOUR OLD STATE TO NEW STATE

4. DISPATCH -> HOW WE CAN ACTUALLY EXECUTE THE ACTION (DISPATCH ACTION TO REDUCER -> REDUCER CHECKS WHAT TO DO -> CHANGES THE STATE IN STORE)
